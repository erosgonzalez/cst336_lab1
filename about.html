                   I love the sport and the feeling of pushing your body to it's max.
                   I also enjoy letting all my frustrations out in the ring and heavy bag.

                   backgrounds for myself to use. I enjoy drawing/doodling in a notebook, 
                   graffiti, photography, and other types of art, such as poetry.
